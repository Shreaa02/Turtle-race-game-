Turtle Racing Game

This is a simple and fun game built using Python's turtle module. In this game, players get to guess which colored turtle will win a race. The game will simulate the race, and a message will be printed on the console to indicate if the player's guess was correct.

How to Play

1)Input your guess:
    At the start of the game, you'll be prompted to enter your guess for which colored turtle (red, blue, green, yellow, etc.) you think will win the race.

2)Watch the race: 
   The turtles will race across the screen, each moving at random speeds.

3)Check the result:
   Once the race is over, a message will be printed on the console indicating the winning turtle and whether your guess was correct.
